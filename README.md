# Video_encryption-dsa-challenge
Here, I have implemented a simple video encryption algorithm using XOR algorithm to protect the videos, so that the algorithm may digitally hide your videos to avoid unauthorised interception and viewing. 


# XOR algorithm
Let us look at XOR encrypt. It returns 1 only when both the values are different else it returns 0.
We have DATA   : 1010
        KEY    : 0010
XOR Encrypt    : 1000

Now, let's look at XOR decrypt.
We will take the encrypted data and apply XOR with key again to get the decrypted data.
XOR Encrypt : 1000
        KEY : 0010
XOR Decrypt : 1010
So, in this way, we get back the original data.
Please look at the video for a sample demo.
